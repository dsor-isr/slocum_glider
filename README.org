#+TITLE: Slocum Glider ROS Interface
#+AUTHOR: MIT MERS Group

This repo contains the =slocum_glider= ROS metapackage. This metapackage
consists of several packages to facilitate communicating with (and controlling)
a Teledyne Webb Research Slocum Glider via a secondary computer. This secondary
computer is called the "backseat driver" because it can get visibility into the
glider state and has (limited) ability to change the behavior of the glider as
it is executing a mission.

The ROS interfaces used to interact with the glider are described in the
=slocum_glider_driver= package.
