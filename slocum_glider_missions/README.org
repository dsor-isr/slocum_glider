#+TITLE: Slocum Glider Missions
#+AUTHOR: MIT MERS Scouts Team

While many Slocum Glider sensors are self-documenting (=m_depth=, =m_heading=,
etc.), some critical ones (the =u_mission_param_*= family) are not. However,
these parameters are critical as they are the ones used to actively modify the
glider's mission.

This package is designed to provide standard mission files that cede a great
deal of control to the backseat driver. Right now, only a single set of such
files is provided. If this is deemed to be insufficient in the future, we will
extend them and provide some sort of mix-and-match capabillity such that the
backseat driver can always know which =u_mission_param='s control what on the
glider.
